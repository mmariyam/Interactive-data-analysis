Programming Assignment, October 2020. 
Department of Computing and Informatics at Bournemouth University, United
Kingdom.

1. Introduction
In this assignment you will explore a social network dataset and present your findings in a
short interactive report created using Jupyter. There is no one best answer and it is up to
you on how you would like to approach the problem.

2. Dataset

The FB-PAGES-FOOD dataset can be downloaded from http://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-food.php

3. Assignment
Using Python and Jupyter with any generally available libraries, perform exploratory analysis
of the social network. This should cover (but is not limited to) standard metrics used in
network analysis and extensive visualisations.
One specific issue weâ€™d like you to look into, is the identification of the most important
node(s) in the network, and the impact of its/their removal.
Your Jupyter notebook should also include some interactive elements using Jupyter
Widgets, which would allow users who do not know how to code, to perform basic network
analysis of the dataset in question.

4. Submission
Please send us the Jupyter notebook with your complete data analysis workflow, relevant
textual descriptions/analysis, visualisations and interactive components.
Please reference any online code that you may have based your analysis on. Aim to write
compact and efficient code with some basic documentation.
